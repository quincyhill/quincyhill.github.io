# My Portfolio
Come check it out

# Notes:
I've noticed some weird glitching in the browser if its updated and the cache isnt reset, eg ctrl + f5.
I'm going to add some js to detect a version change then force a recache if thats the case
So far this issue just is on firefox, the mobile browser doesn't have this issue
Caching issue seems to be just on fire fox

* NoScript
Make a non javascript version of the site that doesnt include any of the funtionality just displays info
